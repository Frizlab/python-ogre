
Jul -Aug 2006:  All the base work done by Larkin and Roman
13 Aug 2006:  Initial Version from Andy
13 Aug 2006:  Roman - fix to Ogre_Generate_code.py to simplify build process (removed 'non exposed'? ENUMS)
                    * Needed to remove cmdXXXX functions etc from ParticleSystem in order to compile correctly
              Change to Ogre_Customization_data.py to add 'NamedValuePairList' mapping
15 Aug 2006:  Andy - addition to Ogre_Generate_code.py to expose additional template classes (initially Controller<float>)
              Fixed ParticleSystem class to remove CmdXXXX functions
              Update to Ogre_Customization_data.py as some mappings had been lost :)
----          Significant improvements to both Py++ and the Ogre wrappers make code generation far simpler
29 Sept 2006: Andy - Update to support both the Ogre CVS and Ogre 1.2.3 code bases.  
              PYPOS project added as a sub driectory (initially)
15 Oct 2006:  Andy - initial release of the binary for windows 0.5/ 0.51 release
18 Nov 2006:  Version 0.6 Windows release.
              Built against the CVS version of Ogre, hence dlls included as part of this release
              CEGUI/OIS/OgreNewt (Newton Physics)/OgreRefApp (ODE Physics) part of the release
              Media is now a seperate download as expected to change (can be cleaned up and shrunk)
26 Nov 2006:  Version 0.65 Windows Release
              Series of minor fixes - added support for MovableObjects in Ogre
              Call backs in OgreNewt now work - or seem too :)  Demos 0-6 working well
              Known problems in a couple of the OgreNewt demos 7 and 8..
02 Jan 2007:  Version 0.70 Windows Release
                Lots of improvements - should have removed all 'No to Python' converter errors in Ogre
                Everything that is 'exposable' should be there
                Documentation strings (pulled from the C++ source) now in the Python Doc Strings..
                Use PyDoc etc against the modules for accurate doc imformation
                Added leading lower case property names (in addition to the typicaly leading Upper case from Ogre)
                Strict testing for property names - only add those that don't confict with Ogre function names 
                which means a number of older properties have been removed - see Pydoc etc..
                New Demos (Demo-Grass etc) showing low level Ogre access (creating raw Vertic buffers etc)
                Fixed many functions that Boost doesn't like by default
                Remove need for path variable to be set - modules do this automajically
                Renamed and cleaned up the demos and their file naming..
                Fixed Demo06 in CEGUI
09 jan 2007;  SNAPSHOT
              Changes to demo01 in OgreNewt showing how to do debug lines
              MANY changes to code generation (with Py++) enhancements - fixing many container classes that wrap pointers
              Demo_renderCreate to show how to create your own render window and uses previously broken wrappers
04 feb 2007:  Version 0.8 Release
                Number of minor tweaks to Ogre, some classes corrected to match the Ogre Library better:
                (NamedValuePairList is now NameValuePairList, FloatController... are now Controller...Float)
                Most calls automatically convert from tuples (or lists) to colourvalues or vectors. So instead of
                having to do an ogre.ColourValue(1,1,1) you can do (1,1,1) 
                CEGUI has been updated a little, more from an internal code creation perspective (less classes unexposed)
                Used the Scons build system for everything 
                OgreAl has been added - we now have simple sound for the library
                ODE and OgreOde have been added for a new physics library - DEMOS have not been completed to expect problems:)
                FMOD has been included for fun, a VERY limited support at present, but will be improved:)
