13 Aug 2006:  Initial Version from Andy
13 Aug 2006:  Roman - fix to Ogre_Generate_code.py to simplify build process (removed 'non exposed'? ENUMS)
                    * Needed to remove cmdXXXX functions etc from ParticleSystem in order to compile correctly
              Change to Ogre_Customization_data.py to add 'NamedValuePairList' mapping
15 Aug 2006:  Andy - addition to Ogre_Generate_code.py to expose additional template classes (initially Controller<float>)
              Fixed ParticleSystem class to remove CmdXXXX functions
              Update to Ogre_Customization_data.py as some mappings had been lost :)

Prerequisits:
=============
Latest CVS version of Boost (www.boost.org) - I suggest you modify the ./boost/python/detail/preprocessor.hpp and change BOOST_PYTHON_MAX_ARITY to 19 (instead of the default 15).  Although this 'should' be done at the command line by making this change before building boost it's something else you don;t have to worry about
BJAM - this is needed to build boost so you should have it anyway
OgreSDK - latest tested version is the prepackaged SDK 1.2.1 for MSVC 7 (www.ogre3d.org)
Python - tested with python version 2.5b3 (earlier betas have XMLbug)  (www.python.org)
MSVC 7 - :)
gccxml - CVS
PYPLUS - Always get the latest SVN version


Building:
=========
Edit OgreRenderQueueSortingGroup.h (in the Ogre SDK include directory) to undefine _OgreExport 
    (It defines each function as a dllexport which causes compile problems...)
Edit the Ogre_Settings.py file to suit your environment
Run the "BuildSource" batch file
Run the "Compile" batch file
You will now have an Ogre.pyd under the bin directory that should work :)
