Package: python-ogre
Architecture: any
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends},
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Description: Python bindings for Ogre 3d engine and a number of other graphic
 and game libraries.
 .
 Python-Ogre is a free open source Python interface to a wide range of C++
 libraries. Focused primarly on supporting the Ogre 3D graphics library and
 other Graphics and Gaming libraries. Python-Ogre allows developers to focus
 on their 'application', taking advantage of the simplicity of Python with 
 the performance and functionality of the underlying libraries.
