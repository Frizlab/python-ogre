xxx 2007: Version 0.91 Release
==============================
* Reverse order of entries in ChangeLog :)
* _ConfigOption name changed to ConfigOption
* << Operators in base source now exposed as __str__ -- makes "print xxx" work well
* Couple of FactoryObj aliases added to clean up names
* Radian/Degree constructor fix added to __init__.py file
* Auto Quaternion conversion (to and from Tuple/list)
* Extended setter properties - functions that take colour/vectors can now be properties taking tuples/lists
   ie. light.colour=0,0,1 || [0,0,1] || (0,0,1) || Ogre.ColourValue(0,0,1)  now work
   
* Identified functions with pointer arguments and used "functional transformation" to make these 'outputs'
   ie. getWorldTransforms() now return a Matrix4 instead of taking a pointer to it as an argument

20 Feb 2007:  Version 0.9 Release
=================================
* Python style iterator access to all Map and Vector iterators 
  (you can still access the iterators using the C++ methods)
  So now a "for r in fm.getResourceIterator():" is valid
* getByName and getByHandle methods of ResourceManager (and it's subclasses)
  now automatically returns the correct Object type - previously it returned
  a 'Resource' (which is how the C++ library works) - now it will return a 
  Texture/Font/Mesh as appropiate
* Documentation has been improved - all "Special Funtions/modifications" 
  have pydoc strings that start with "Python-Ogre...."
* New return policies have allowed us to exposed 'Image::getData', 
  MemoryDataStream::getPtr' etc
* Factory classes have been included (again) in the build - there was 
  dicusssion as to how useful they might be but there isn't any harm...
* OgreOde demos included in the release
* Matrix3[0..2] returns a tuple holding the matrix row
* Minor improvements in tuple handling, multiplication of Quats etc works again
* Built with the CVS version of Ogre 1.4RC1..
* Getmultimapsettings helper function removed as multimaps now fully supported..
    ### settings_tuples = config.getMultiMapSettings(settings)
    ##for resource_type, resource in settings_tuples:
    ##    self.rgm.addResourceLocation(resource, resource_type, section_name)
    for item in settings:
        self.rgm.addResourceLocation(item.value, item.key, section_name)            
* _ConfigOption and other structures exposed correctly and now work
              
04 feb 2007:  Version 0.8 Release
=================================
* Number of minor tweaks to Ogre, some classes corrected to match the Ogre Library better:
   (NamedValuePairList is now NameValuePairList, FloatController... are now Controller...Float)
* Most calls automatically convert from tuples (or lists) to colourvalues or vectors. So instead of
   having to do an ogre.ColourValue(1,1,1) you can do (1,1,1) 
* CEGUI has been updated a little, more from an internal code creation perspective (less classes unexposed)
* Used the Scons build system for everything 
* OgreAl has been added - we now have simple sound for the library
* ODE and OgreOde have been added for a new physics library - DEMOS have not been completed - expect problems:)
* FMOD has been included for fun, a VERY limited support at present, but will be improved:)  
                            
09 jan 2007:  SNAPSHOT
======================
              Changes to demo01 in OgreNewt showing how to do debug lines
              MANY changes to code generation (with Py++) enhancements - fixing many container classes that wrap pointers
              Demo_renderCreate to show how to create your own render window and uses previously broken wrappers
02 Jan 2007:  Version 0.70 Windows Release
                Lots of improvements - should have removed all 'No to Python' converter errors in Ogre
                Everything that is 'exposable' should be there
                Documentation strings (pulled from the C++ source) now in the Python Doc Strings..
                Use PyDoc etc against the modules for accurate doc imformation
                Added leading lower case property names (in addition to the typicaly leading Upper case from Ogre)
                Strict testing for property names - only add those that don't confict with Ogre function names 
                which means a number of older properties have been removed - see Pydoc etc..
                New Demos (Demo-Grass etc) showing low level Ogre access (creating raw Vertic buffers etc)
                Fixed many functions that Boost doesn't like by default
                Remove need for path variable to be set - modules do this automajically
                Renamed and cleaned up the demos and their file naming..
                Fixed Demo06 in CEGUI
26 Nov 2006:  Version 0.65 Windows Release
              Series of minor fixes - added support for MovableObjects in Ogre
              Call backs in OgreNewt now work - or seem too :)  Demos 0-6 working well
              Known problems in a couple of the OgreNewt demos 7 and 8..
18 Nov 2006:  Version 0.6 Windows release.
              Built against the CVS version of Ogre, hence dlls included as part of this release
              CEGUI/OIS/OgreNewt (Newton Physics)/OgreRefApp (ODE Physics) part of the release
              Media is now a seperate download as expected to change (can be cleaned up and shrunk)
15 Oct 2006:  Andy - initial release of the binary for windows 0.5/ 0.51 release
29 Sept 2006: Andy - Update to support both the Ogre CVS and Ogre 1.2.3 code bases.  
              PYPOS project added as a sub driectory (initially)
15 Aug 2006:  Andy - addition to Ogre_Generate_code.py to expose additional template classes (initially Controller<float>)
              Fixed ParticleSystem class to remove CmdXXXX functions
              Update to Ogre_Customization_data.py as some mappings had been lost :)
----          Significant improvements to both Py++ and the Ogre wrappers make code generation far simpler
13 Aug 2006:  Roman - fix to Ogre_Generate_code.py to simplify build process (removed 'non exposed'? ENUMS)
                    * Needed to remove cmdXXXX functions etc from ParticleSystem in order to compile correctly
              Change to Ogre_Customization_data.py to add 'NamedValuePairList' mapping
13 Aug 2006:  Initial Version from Andy
Jul -Aug 2006:  All the base work done by Larkin and Roman
