
Jul -Aug 2006:  All the base work done by Larkin and Roman
13 Aug 2006:  Initial Version from Andy
13 Aug 2006:  Roman - fix to Ogre_Generate_code.py to simplify build process (removed 'non exposed'? ENUMS)
                    * Needed to remove cmdXXXX functions etc from ParticleSystem in order to compile correctly
              Change to Ogre_Customization_data.py to add 'NamedValuePairList' mapping
15 Aug 2006:  Andy - addition to Ogre_Generate_code.py to expose additional template classes (initially Controller<float>)
              Fixed ParticleSystem class to remove CmdXXXX functions
              Update to Ogre_Customization_data.py as some mappings had been lost :)
----          Significant improvements to both Py++ and the Ogre wrappers make code generation far simpler
29 Sept 2006: Andy - Update to support both the Ogre CVS and Ogre 1.2.3 code bases.  
              PYPOS project added as a sub driectory (initially)
15 Oct 2006:  Andy - initial release of the binary for windows Verison 0.5
22 Oct 2006:  Version 0.5.1  
              Removed hard coding of the resources loaded - resource.cfg is now used - see _setUpResources in sf.py
              Added Ogre.GetOgreVersion() and Ogre.GetPythonOgreVersion() to allow for future flexibility in demo support
              Fixed a couple of small bugs in the sample framework (typos in setting NearDepth and BackgoundColour)
              Fixed bug in Skelatal demo where global variable wasn't defined and used
