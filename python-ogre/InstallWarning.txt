WARNING...

As part of the Python-Ogre installation we will remove any existing (previous) versions of Python-Ogre

This typically means deleting the Ogre, OIS, CEGUI, OgreRefApp, ODE, OgreNewt, and OgreOde directories in
your python]lib\site-packages directory.

This version of Python-Ogre introduces a new module layout form and will require that you make minor
changes to your import statments in any existing python code.

If you don't want this to happen please cancel now
