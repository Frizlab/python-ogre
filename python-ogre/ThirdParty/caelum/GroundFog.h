 *  This class controls CaelumGroundFog passes in a potentially large number
 *  of materials, changing shader program parameters. This class keeps a list
 *  of passes to control; which can be build based on pass name.
 *
 *  This simulates a field of fog where "absorption" at a certain point is
 *	exp(-verticalDecay * (h - fogLevel)). This absorption is multiplicative,
 *	the total fog alpha is e^(-density * absorption_on_view_path).
 *
 *	You can set verticalDecay to 0 and get standard GL_EXP fog. Don't actually
 *	do that though because you'll get a division by 0.
