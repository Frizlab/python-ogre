		  A PoolSet stores a pool of pre-constructed queries which are used as needed when

		  without incurring construction / destruction costs. This method allows you to configure
		  the behavior when a new object is requested  but the object pool has been exhausted.
		  @par
		  The default behavior is to allow the pool to extend (typically this allocates double the current
		  pool of queries when the pool is expended), equivalent to calling this method with
		  autoExtend = true. If you set the parameter to false however, any attempt to create a new pooled object
		  when the pool has expired will simply fail silently, returning a null pointer.

		  of ignoring you if too many objects are already in use. Bear in mind that calling this method will
