Notes on building the python-ogre code for Windows

Updated by Andy: 13 Aug 2006

Prerequisits:
=============
Latest CVS version of Boost (www.boost.org) - I suggest you modify the ./boost/python/detail/preprocessor.hpp and change BOOST_PYTHON_MAX_ARITY to 19 (instead of the default 15).  Although this 'should' be done at the command line by making this change before building boost it's something else you don;t have to worry about
BJAM - this is needed to build boost so you should have it anyway
OgreSDK - latest tested version is the prepackaged SDK 1.2.1 for MSVC 7 (www.ogre3d.org)
Python - tested with python version 2.5 (www.python.org)
MSVC 7 - :)
gccxml
PYPLUS - Always get the latest SVN version


Building:
=========
Edit the Ogre_Settings.py file to suit your environment
Run the "BuildSource" batch file

Manually edit the following files and comment out (remove) the lines shown


Run the "Compile" batch file
You will now have an Ogre.pyd under the bin directory that should work :)
