Description: Software build tool 
 Boost.Jam (BJam) is a portable build tool with its own interpreted language,
 which allows to implement rather complex logic in a readable way and without
 resorting to external programs. It is a descendant of Jam/MR tool modified to
 suit the needs of Boost.Build. In particular, modules and rule parameters
 were added, as well as several new builtins.
