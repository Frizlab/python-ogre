GCCXML was Debianized on 2006-03-12 by Steven Robbins <smr@debian.org>,
building on previous work by Maciej Dems.

Source may be obtained from http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Download.html.

GCCXML comprises a modified version of the GNU GCC front end, together
with some extra logic from Kitware, Inc.  In addition to that, there
are several pieces of platform-support code from other sources.  

This file lists all copyright and license notices found in the sources
with two exceptions: the entire directory GCC_XML/Support/Borland has
been removed from the original sources, as it contains some files that
are not redistributable under the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
The copyright notices from this directory are not reported here.
Similarly, GCC/libiberty/xatexit.c is removed as it has no explicit
permission to distribute.
