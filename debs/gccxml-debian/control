Description: XML output extension to GCC
 There is one open-source C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which
 is currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The
 purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of
 a C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy to
 parse, other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs
 without the burden of a complicated C++ parser.
